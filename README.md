An HTML and CSS only landing page about Clint Eastwood.

in this project, I have made a landing page about clint eastwood, which include a fixed to top navigation bar, photo gallery, qr code that sends to the web page.
The page includes an embeded youtube video, google fonts and more...

In addition the page includes a html form that sends an Email using the Windows Outlook, which has a dropdown menu of emojis to add to the email message content.
